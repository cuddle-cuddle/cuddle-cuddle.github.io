I've done many things in my life.
Started off with computer science, ended up with a Pure Math degree. Went to grad school for Physics, came out without a PhD. Being a web-dev for a while, but my heart is still in machine learning.

Life comes full circle.

... and yes, I'm still looking for that ML dream job.
